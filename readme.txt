How to run program

1.) Type in c++ main.cpp then press enter
2.) Type in ./a.out then press enter and program will begin
3.) Program will ask you "Enter a simulation length"
	enter in any integer number you want then press enter
	(Do not enter a decimal number)
4.) Program will ask you "Enter Landing Arrival Rate"
	enter in a decimal number you want to simulate then press enter
5.) Program will ask you "Enter Takeoff Arrival Rate"
	enter in a decimal number you want to simulate then press enter
6.) Program will ask you "Enter landing time for an airplane"
	enter in an integer you want to simulate then press enter 
	(Do not put in a decimal number)
7.) Program will ask you "Enter takeoff time for an airplane"
	enter in an integer you want to simulate then press enter
	(Do not put in a decimal number)
8.) The rest of the program will begin and simulation will start
9.) Outputs of the simulation will display and the simulation will end
10.) Program will ask you if you would like to run another simulation
	enter y if want to and n if you want to end program
	if y then program will start over at step 3
	if n then program will completely stop
